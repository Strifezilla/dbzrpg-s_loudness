■dbzrpgに提供するoggの調整について

ラウドネス測定（但しITU-R提唱のBS.1770-4準拠）による楽曲間平均化処理を行い、
次におおよそ-1.9db～1.9db程度の範囲で個別に再調整。
ただしこの方法で不具合が生じたファイルについては別途独自に調整。


なお平均的に調整、といっても結局のところ聴こえ方は人それぞれ。
（個々人の脳の状態の他、スピーカーでも変化）
大まかに平均的かと思う程度の調整に留めている。

なるべく多くの人が音量の問題を感じないようにしたいところだが…
なにかうまい方法はないかな

■ Adjustment of BGM additional song candidates provided to dbzrpg
<br>
Performs inter-music averaging processing by loudness measurement (however, based on BS.1770-4 advocated by ITU-R), and then readjusts individually in the range of approximately -1.9db to 1.9db. However, files that have problems with this method are adjusted separately.

It should be noted that the average adjustment is made, but in the end, each person hears differently. (In addition to the state of the individual's brain, it also changes with the speaker) The adjustment is limited to a level that seems to be roughly average.

I want as many people as possible not to feel the volume problem, but ... Is there any good way? 


Proper Translation:

Regarding the adjustment of OGG files provided to DBZRPG:

We will perform an averaging process between tracks using loudness measurements (in accordance with ITU-R's BS.1770-4 standards), followed by individual readjustments within a range of approximately -1.9dB to 1.9dB. However, for files that experience issues using this method, we will adjust them separately as needed.

That said, even with an "average adjustment," how people perceive sound ultimately varies from person to person. (This can be influenced by the state of an individual's brain as well as the speakers used.) We are keeping the adjustments to what we believe is a generally average level.

We want to ensure that as many people as possible don't experience any volume-related issues, but... I wonder if there is a better way to achieve this.
